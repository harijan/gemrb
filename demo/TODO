if ready by release, add to install targets, sample config (gametype!) and
 add instructions with a preconfigured config. Decide about including fonts.

See this checklist:
https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/issues/313

OLD NOTES
fist.itm is missing some resources like icons
chitin.key is not updated

CONSIDER REMOVING:
- the fonts, now included for easier testing (otherwise add all the needed boilerplate)
